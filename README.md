## Objectives
* Implement basic arithmetic operations with two numbers
* Write Unit Tests for some of the arithmetic operations
* Execute and Test the calculator application
* Implement new methods to support floating point arithmetic operations using method overloading
* Debug and Handle Exceptions for invalid data
* Write unit tests to validate the Exception being thrown
* Extend the existing class to support new features for a Scientific Calculator
* Re-use and improve upon the existing features
* Fix compilation errors caused probably due to syntax / import issues
* Correct logical issues in the code
* Fix the behaviour of a method when data is invalid
* Write Unit Tests for edge cases initially not thought of
